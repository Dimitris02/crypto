# crypto
encrypt messages and decript them using a shared key

The program combines hashing and Vigen√®re cipher. When the program starts insert the desired key, they key will be hashed and used for encodings and decodings
later on. Then choose whether you want to encode or decode a message. Before encryption, a few spaces are added to the end of the input string to create
more ambiguity around the length of the message. 

If the receiver of the encoded message has the key with which it was encoded he will be able to read it using the decode option in the menu
